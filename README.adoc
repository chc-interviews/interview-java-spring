I = 1
V = 5
X = 10
L = 50
C = 100
D = 500
M = 1000

If a smaller value is placed before a larger one, subtract instead of add.

IV      = 4 = 5 - 1
VI      = 6 = 5 + 1
IX      = 9 = 10 - 1
XIV     = 14 = 10 + (5 - 1)
XL      = 40 = 50 - 10
XLI     = 41 = 50 + 1 - 10
LI      = 51 = 50 + 1
XC      = 90 = 100 - 10
CD      = 400 = 500 - 100
CM      = 900 = 1000 - 100
MC      = 1100 = 1000 + 100

982
= 900 + 80 + 2
= CM + LXXX + II
= CMLXXXII

Only one I, X, and C can be used as the leading numeral in part of a subtractive pair.
I can only be placed before V and X.
X can only be placed before L and C.
C can only be placed before D and M.
